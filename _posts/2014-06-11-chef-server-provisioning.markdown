Okay, today I'm wearing my chef loves bacon hat. Today's goal is to get started with Chef for provisioning load balanced API servers.


I'll be starting out on a [railscast][railscast] video. Well this video is on chef-solo and I'll be using chef server, so not as much help as I was hoping. Next I went through this [tutorial][gettingstartedwithchef], but it just flat out didn't work, so I stopped half way through. My boss suggested this [video series][learnchef], but it is beyond boring and overly complex. We'll be using [opscode][opscode] to host our chef server.
